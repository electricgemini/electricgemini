# Stellar
Stellar is a content-ready single-page web app connected to the [Cosmic JS API](https://cosmicjs.com).  It's built on a light Node.js server with a front end by [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn) at [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).  You can edit pretty much everything on the page in the Cosmic JS CMS.  [Sign up for Cosmic JS](https://cosmicjs.com) to install this app and edit the content in your own bucket.  To run locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/cosmicjs/cosmicapp-stellar
cd cosmicapp-stellar
npm install
npm start
```
